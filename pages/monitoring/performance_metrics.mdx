## Model Performance Metrics

Athina is designed to help you measure your model performance in production.

If you have configured [automatic evals](/evals/automatic_evals) to run against your logged inferences, then your dashboard will automatically populate with a breakdown of your model performance metrics.

Click on the `Performance Metrics` section on the top left of your dashboard to see a breakdown of the model performance metrics.

### How to interpret Eval Metrics

- Evals may have 1 or more metrics configured.
- Most metrics will be scored between 0.0 and 1.0, with 1.0 being the best possible score.
- Boolean metrics will contain a Pass (1.0) / Fail (0.0) result.
- Numeric metrics will contain a score between 0.0 and 1.0.

**Pass Rate** = The percentage of inferences that passed **all** of the configured boolean evals.
