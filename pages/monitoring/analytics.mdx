# Analytics and Insights

<img src="/athina-analytics-dashboard-26-nov.png" />

In addition to running evals, Athina provides advanced analytics and monitoring.

It allows you to track usage patterns, monitor conversations, and gain insights from the data generated by your models.

By leveraging these features, you can make data-driven decisions, optimize your models, and improve the overall user experience.

### Overview

Analytics jobs will run once per day.

We store data at the `daily` level, so we have granular "per-day" analytics, but not per-hour.

We can segment your data by:

- `environment`
- `prompt_slug`
- `customer_id`
- `topic`
- `language_model_id`

You can explore your analytics in the [Analytics Dashboard](https://app.athina.ai/dashboard) page or on the [Observe](https://app.athina.ai/observe) page
