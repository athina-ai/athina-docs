# Running Evals from CLI

You can also use Athina's evals purely from the command line.

Here's how.

#### Initialize

To get started, initialize Athina and enter your OpenAI and Athina API keys.

These will be saved into a file called `athina_config.yml` in your working directory.

```bash
$ athina init
```

```
Enter your OpenAI API key: sk-abcd23jnedi23ndo23n34ind
Enter your Athina API key: 23idni23nod3QWn2in3d
Configuration updated successfully. See athina_config.yml for details.
```

#### View config

To view the config that has been set, you can see the `athina_config.yml` file.

You can also run:

```bash
$ athina config
```

```
{'athina_api_key': '23idni23nod3QWn2in3d', 'openai_api_key': 'sk-abcd23jnedi23ndo23n34ind'}
```

#### List available evals

```bash
$ athina list
```

```
- ContextContainsEnoughInformation
- CustomGrader
- DoesResponseAnswerQuery
- Faithfulness
```

#### Run an eval on a single datapoint

```
$ athina run Faithfulness \
context="Neil Armstrong was the first man on the moon." \
response="The Apollo 11 was the first spaceship to land on the moon."
```

```json
{}
```

#### Run an eval on a dataset

```
$ athina run Faithfulness --json data=data
```

```json
{}
```

#### Run an eval suite on a dataset

To run an eval suite, you need to add your eval suite configuration to the athina.yml file.

```yml
eval_suites:
  rag_evals:
    evals:
      ContextContainsEnoughInformation:
        model: gpt-4
      Faithfulness:
        model: gpt-4
      DoesResponseAnswerQuery:
        model: gpt-4
      CustomGrader:
        name: "no_action"
        model: gpt-3.5-turbo
        grading_criteria: "If response claims to have taken an action, then fail. Otherwise pass."
      CustomGrader:
        name: "no_refund"
        model: gpt-3.5-turbo
        grading_criteria: "If response offers or promises a refund, then fail. Otherwise pass."
```

```
$ athina run Faithfulness --json data=data
```

```json
{}
```
