# How can I ensure my evals will perform well?

**Use GPT-4** (especially if your eval task requires reasoning capabilities)

- `gpt-4` will perform _much_ better than GPT 3.5 if your eval task is complex.
- For simple tasks, you can use `gpt-3.5-turbo` or sometimes an even cheaper model.

**Provide custom examples**

Providing some custom few-shot examples suited to your use case are likely to improve the performance of your evals further.

**Set up [custom evals](/evals/custom_evaluators)**

Using a completely custom eval is likely the best way to tailor your eval to work perfectly for your use case.
