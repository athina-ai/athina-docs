# Running a suite of evals

##### 1. Load the data

See the instructions on [how to load data](/evals/loading_data) for details

```python
from athina.loaders import RagLoader

dataset = RagLoader().load_dict(raw_data)
```

##### 2. Run the eval suite

```python
from athina.evals import ContextContainsEnoughInformation, DoesResponseAnswerQuery, Faithfulness

# Define your eval suite
eval_suite = [
    ContextContainsEnoughInformation(),
    DoesResponseAnswerQuery(),
    Faithfulness(),
]

# Run the evaluation suite
result = EvalRunner.run_batch(evals=eval_suite, dataset=dataset)

print(result)
```

##### Response Format

This will return a batch result object like this:
