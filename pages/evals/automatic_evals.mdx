# Automatic Evals

### What is an automatic eval?

If you are [logging inferences](/logging) to Athina, you can **configure evals to run automatically against logged inferences**.

Eval results will show up on your dashboard as soon as they start running.

- The metrics from these evals will be used to calculate the [model performance metrics](/monitoring/performance_metrics).

- The evaluation results for each individual inference are visible in the **Evals** tab on the [Inference Trace](/monitoring/inference_trace) page (`/observe/inference/:inference_id`).
