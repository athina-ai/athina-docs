### Why should I use Athina's Eval framework instead of writing my own evals?

You could build your own eval system from scratch, but here's why [Athina](https://github.com/athina-ai/athina-evals) might be better for you.

- Athina provides you with plug-and-play [preset evals](/evals/preset_evals/rag_evals) that have been well-tested
- Athina evals can run on both development and production, giving you consistent metrics for evaluating model performance and drift.
- Athina removes the need for your team to write boilerplate loaders, implement LLMs, normalize data formats, etc
- Athina offers a modular, extensible framework for writing and running evals
- Athina calculate analytics like pass rate and flakiness, and allows you to batch run evals against live production data or dev datasets

### Athina Develop: A UI for your iterations

- Athina Evals also automatically integrate into a UI that allows you to view results, metrics, and historical records in a user-friendly dashboard.

- Your track your experiments automatically, so you can view a historical record of previous eval runs, including a history of your prompts, models, datasets and more.
