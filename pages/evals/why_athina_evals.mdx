### Why should I use Athina's Eval framework instead of writing my own evals?

You could build your own eval system from scratch, but here's why Athina might be better for you.

- Athina provides you with plug-and-play [preset evals](/evals/preset_evals/rag_evals) that have been well-tested
- Athina evals can run on both development and production, giving you consistent metrics for evaluating model performance and drift.
- Athina removes the need for your team to write boilerplate loaders, implement LLMs, normalize data formats, etc
- Athina offers a modular, extensible framework for writing and running evals
- Athina calculate analytics like pass rate and flakiness, and allows you to batch run evals against live production data or dev datasets

**Athina's Web Platform is also integrated with our evals framework.**

- Athina eval runs automatically write into Athina Dashboard, so you can view results and analytics in a beautiful UI.
- Athina track your experiments automatically, so you can view a historical record of previous eval runs.
- Athina calculates analytics segmented at every level possible, so you can view and compare your model performance at **very** granular levels.
  - _"How is my model performing for queries related to `refunds` using prompt `cs_v2.3` with `gpt-4` `last week`"_
