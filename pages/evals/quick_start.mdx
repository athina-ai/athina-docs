# Quick Start

There are 2 ways to use Athina Evals.

1. **[Configure automatic evals](/evals/automatic_evals) in the dashboard:** These will run automatically on your logged inferences, and you can view the results in the dashboard.

2. **[Run evals programmatically](/evals/running_evals) using the Python SDK:** This is useful for running evals on your own datasets to iterate rapidly during development.

---

## Run Evals Programmatically

To get started with Athina Evals:

**1. Install the `athina` package**

```
pip install athina
```

**2. Set your API keys**

If you are using the python SDK, then can set the API keys like this:

```python
from athina.keys import AthinaApiKey, OpenAiApiKey

OpenAiApiKey.set_key(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
AthinaApiKey.set_key(os.getenv('ATHINA_API_KEY'))
```

If you are using the CLI, then run `athina init`, and enter the API keys when prompted.

**3. Load your dataset like this:**

_You can also [load data](/evals/loading_data) using a CSV or Python Dictionary_

```python
from athina.loaders import RagLoader

dataset = RagLoader().load_json(json_filepath)
```

**4. Now you can run evals like this.**

```python
from athina.evals import DoesResponseAnswerQuery

DoesResponseAnswerQuery().run_batch(data=dataset)
```

For more details, see this guide on [running evals](/evals/running_evals).
