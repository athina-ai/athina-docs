## Custom Evals

_Need to use your own custom evals?_

There are a number of ways to use custom evals in Athina.

- [`GradingCriteria`](/evals/custom_evals/api_call): Pass / fail based on a custom criterion. _"If X, then fail. Otherwise pass."_
- [`CustomPrompt`](/evals/custom_evals/custom_prompt): Use a completely custom prompt for evaluation.
- [`ApiCall`](/evals/custom_evals/api_call): Use the `ApiCall` evaluator to make a call to a custom endpoint where you are hosting your evaluation logic.
- [Create your own evaluator](/evals/custom_evals/write_your_own): Create your own evaluator by extending the [`BaseEvaluator`](https://github.com/athina-ai/athina-evals/blob/main/athina/evals/base_evaluator.py) class.

### Contribute your evals!
