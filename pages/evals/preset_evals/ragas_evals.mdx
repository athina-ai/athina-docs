## How to Run

##### ▷ Set up RAGAS to run automatically on your logged inferences

If you are logging to Athina, you can configure RAGAS to run automatically against your logs.

1. Navigate to the [Athina Dashboard](https://app.athina.ai/evals/config)
2. Open the evals page (lightning icon on the left)
3. Click the "New Eval" button on the top right
4. Select the "RAGAS" tab
5. Select the eval you want to configure

##### ▷ Run the RAGAS eval on a single datapoint

```python
from athina.evals import RagasAnswerRelevancy

data = {
        "query": "Where is France and what is it's capital?",
        "contexts": ["France is the country in europe known for delicious cuisine", "Tesla is an electric car", "Elephant is an animal"],
        "response": "Tesla is an electric car",
    }
eval_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
RagasAnswerRelevancy(model=eval_model).run(**data).to_df()
```

---

##### ▷ Run the RAGAS eval on a dataset

1. Load your data with the `RagasLoader`

```python
from athina.loaders import RagasLoader
data = [
    {
        "query": "Where is France and what is it's capital?",
        "contexts": ["France is the country in europe known for delicious cuisine", "Tesla is an electric car", "Elephant is an animal"],
        "response": "Tesla is an electric car",
    },
    {
        "query": "Where is France and what is it's capital?",
        "contexts": ["France is the country in europe known for delicious cuisine", "Paris is the capital of france"],
        "response": "France is in western Europe and Paris is its capital",
    },
]

# Load the data from CSV, JSON, Athina or Dictionary
dataset = RagasLoader().load_dict(data)

```

2. Run the evaluator on your dataset

```python
from athina.evals import RagasAnswerRelevancy

eval_model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
RagasAnswerRelevancy(model=eval_model).run_batch(data=dataset).to_df()
```
