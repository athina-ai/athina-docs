# Open Source Evaluation: Philosophy

There are hosts of challenges around running preset evaluations for different data formats.

We had to iterate through dozens of different ideas (it took a lot longer than we thought), but eventually we figured out a setup that works.

Here is the guiding philosophy behind our [open-source evaluation library](https://github.com/athina-ai/athina-evals).

### Preset evals must be plug and play

`pip install athina`

```python
# Evaluate a dataset across a suite of eval criteria
EvalRunner.run_suite(
    evals=[
        RagasAnswerCorrectness(),
        RagasContextPrecision(),
        RagasContextRelevancy(),
        RagasContextRecall(),
        RagasFaithfulness(),
        ResponseFaithfulness(),
        Groundedness(),
        ContextSufficiency(),
    ],
    data=dataset,
    max_parallel_evals=10
)
```

All the code you need to run a suite of 9 evals on your RAG pipeline.

### Evals must be modular and extensible

- Simply import and use.
- Evals usually shouldn't require any constructor arguments
- Evals should be easy to extend
- Evals should be customizable
- Should have easy to use wrappers for custom evals:
  - Grading Criteria: For very simple "If X, then fail. Otherwise pass" style evaluations
  - Custom Prompt: Plug in your own evaluation prompt
  - API Call: If you need complete control of your evals, you can define the eval functions on your own API server.

### Evals should run locally wherever possible

By design, we want most of the evaluations themselves to be open source and to run locally wherever possible.

We wanted to ensure that evaluations run independently of Athina platform, so as to respect the privacy of the data.

### Evals should not be tightly coupled to a single model / provider

Most of our evaluations can easily run on different models and providers (including OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, and Cohere)

### Evals should be able to run in parallel

Evals should be able to run in parallel, and users should be able to control the number of parallel evals.

```python
# Evaluate a dataset across a suite of eval criteria
EvalRunner.run_suite(
    evals=eval_suite,
    data=dataset,
    max_parallel_evals=10
)
```

### Athina API key must not be required to run the evaluations.

There is no requirement to use an Athina API key to run evaluations locally.

But, if you add your AthinaApiKey, you will also get access to a full development SDK with a history of runs, search, sort, filter, compare, re-run, etc.

### Separate Orchestration Layer for Continuous Evaluation and Production Monitoring.

Athina's eval [orchestration](/concepts/orchestration) platform manages eval configurations, sampling, filtering, deduping, rate limiting, switching between different model providers, alerting, and calculating granular analytics to provide a complete evaluation platform.

You can run Evals during [development](/evals/running_evals), in [CI / CD](/evals/ci_cd_pipeline), as [real-time guardrails](/evals/running_evals), or in [production](/evals/running_evals).

Or ideally, all of the above :)
