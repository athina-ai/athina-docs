## Topic Classification

When you log inferences with a `user_query` field, we will automatically run query topic classification against every logged inference.

### Configure your Topics

You can configure your topics in your [Settings](https://app.athina.ai/dashboard) page.

Currently, we will categorize each user query into a single topic label.

So it is best to configure non-overlapping topics.

**Example Topics**

- Product Question
- Refunds
- Order Status
- Exchanges
- Complaints
- Product Availability
- Shipping

</Callout>

### Explore your data, segmented by topic

When you apply a topic filter on the [Observe](https://app.athina.ai/observe) page or the [Analytics](https://app.athina.ai/dashboard) page, the usage and performance metrics will also update to only include inferences labeled with the selected topic.

This can help you narrow down to only look at inferences that were categorized into a certain topic.

<Callout type="info">
  **Example:** you may find that your model's pass rate is 85% for Product
  Questions, but only 68% for queries about Refunds.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **Example:** you may discover that your model's average response time is 1.3s
  for queries about Shipping, but 5.4s for queries about Product Availability.
