# Measure your Performance

_"What doesn't get measured doesn't get managed"_

<br />

Athina lets you measure the performance of your production LLM application to discover how it is doing in various scenarios.

Here are a number of ways you can measure your AI using Athina.

- **Human feedback**: Collect 👍 / 👎 feedback from your user's.
- **Inferred feedback**: Log inferred feedback from user actions as an additional data point.
- **Prebuilt Evals**: Automatic evaluators help you understand where your AI is underperforming.
- **Custom Evals**: Write your own evals to detect issues with your AI using our library to seamlessly log the data into your Athina dashboard.

Use these feedback metrics to explore your LLM data at a granular level.
