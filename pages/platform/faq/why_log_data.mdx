# Why Log Data

When you log your prompt, response pairs using our SDK, you can:

- Use our [observability platform](../platform/overview) for visibility and analytics.

  - For example, you can access metrics like `response time`, `cost`, `token usage`, etc out of the box, and you can also tag your prompt, response pairs with additional metadata like `user_id`, `prompt-version`, `language_model_id`, etc for better segmentation of your data.
  - We automatically analyze the conversations to give you insights into what your user's are asking about, and how your AI is responding.

- Measure your AI's performance

- Automatically start detecting bad outputs with our [prebuilt evals](/evals/preset_evals/rag_evals)

- Run your custom evals against production outputs

- Explore and understand how and where your AI app is underperforming
