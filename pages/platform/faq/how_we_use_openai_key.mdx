## How we use your OpenAI API key

We use your OpenAI key to:

1. Run eval jobs that you have configured
2. Classify your user query topics (Uses `gpt-3.5-turbo`)

---

### Usage limits

You can open your [settings page](https://app.athina.ai/settings) to view and configure the maximum number of evals that we would run per month.

Note that this limit only applies to eval jobs, and not to topic classification.

Topic classification will run on all queries logged to us.
