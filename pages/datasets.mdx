# Datasets

A dataset in Athina consists of rows and columns. These datasets play a pivotal role in the eval process, serving as benchmarks for measuring progress and identifying areas for improvement.

## Importance of Datasets

Datasets are crucial for several reasons:

- **Benchmarking**: They establish a baseline for evaluating LLM performance.
- **Consistency**: Enable consistent testing across different development stages and model iterations.
- **Variability**: Represent a wide range of inputs to test the LLM's robustness and versatility.
- **Regression Testing**: Help in identifying regressions or degradation in performance over time.
- **Fine-tuning**: Enable fine-tuning of the LLM using this dataset to improve performance.
