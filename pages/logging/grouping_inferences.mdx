# Grouping Inferences

To associate different inference calls into a common conversation, you need to include
a `session_id` parameter in your inference log.

When you include the `session_id` field, we will automatically group all the inferences from that conversation together,
so you can view them together on the Inference Detail Page.

_Conversation history is visible on the left panel in the screenshot below._

  Note: You can also use this to group chained inference calls together.
