## Q. Is this SDK going to make a proxy request to OpenAI through Athina?

Nope! We know how important your OpenAI inference call is, so we don't want to interfere with that or increase response times.

Instead, we simply make a (completely separate) logging API request to Athina, which doesn't interfere with your OpenAI request at all.
