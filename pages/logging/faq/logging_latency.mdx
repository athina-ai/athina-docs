## Q. Will the Athina logging SDK increase my latency?

Nope! The logging call is being made in a background thread as a fire and forget request, so there is almost no additional latency (< 5ms).

If you are logging using an API request instead of using the SDK, you should wrap it in a similar fire and forget mechanism to avoid any latency increase.
