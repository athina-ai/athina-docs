## Log via API Request

You can log your inference calls to Athina via a simple API request. The logging request should be made just after you receive a response from the LLM.

- **Method**: `POST`

- **Endpoint**: `https://log.athina.ai/api/v1/log/inference`

- **Headers**: `athina-api-key`: YOUR_ATHINA_API_KEY

##### Request Body

Here's a simple logging request:

```json
{
    "language_model_id": "gpt-4",
    "prompt": [{ "role": "user", "content": "Translate this to french: hello, world" }],
    "response": chatCompletionResponse
}
```

- `language_model_id` (string) is the ID of the language model used for inference. See the list of [supported language models](/logging/supported_models).
- `prompt` is the prompt used for inference. This can be either a `string` or the `messages` array sent to OpenAI.
- `response` is the response from the LLM. This can be either a `string` or the `ChatCompletion` response object from OpenAI.

<Callout>
  Tip: Include your logging code in a try/catch block to ensure that your
  application doesn't crash if the logging request fails.
</Callout>

##### Eval Fields

For [evals](/evals/preset_evals/rag_evals), you must also log these fields:

```json
{
    // ...otherFields,
    "user_query": user_query,
    "context": context
}
```

- `user_query` (string) is the user's query. For conversational applications, this is the user's last message.
- `context` is the context used as information for the prompt. For RAG applications, this is the "retrieved" data.
  - You may log context as a `string` or as an `object` (dictionary).

##### Usage Metadata Fields

You should also add the following fields so that we can track and display analytics around token usage, cost and response time

```json
{
  // ...otherFields,
  "prompt_tokens": 50, // tokens in the prompt
  "completion_tokens": 30, // tokens in the completion response
  "total_tokens": 80, // prompt_tokens + completion_tokens
  "response_time": 1208 // in milliseconds
}
```

- `response_time` (integer) is the response time in milliseconds. This is useful for segmenting inference calls by response time.

<Callout>
  Tip: If you log the entire OpenAI `ChatCompletion` response object to us,
  we'll automatically extract the token counts and cost.
</Callout>

##### Segmentation Fields

Optionally, you can also add the following fields for better segmentation on the dashboard

```json
{
  // ...otherFields,
  "prompt_slug": "customer_support",
  "environment": "production",
  "customer_id": "stripe",
  "customer_user_id": "shiv@athina.ai",
  "session_id": "c45g-1234-s6g4-43d3",
  "cost": 0.01,
  "external_reference_id": "5e838eaf-7dd0-4b6f-a32c-26110dd54e58",
  "expected_response": "Reference response to compare against for evaluation purposes"
}
```

- `prompt_slug` (string) is the identifier for the prompt used for inference. This is useful for segmenting inference calls by prompt.
- `environment` (string) is the environment your app is running in (ex: `production`, `staging`, etc). This is useful for segmenting inference calls by environment.
- `customer_id` (string) is your customer ID. This is useful for segmenting inference calls by customer.
- `customer_user_id` (string) is the end user ID. This is useful for segmenting inference calls by the end user.
- `cost` (number) is the cost incurred while using the LLm model for the API.
- `session_id` (string) is the session or conversation ID. This is used for grouping different inferences into a conversation or chain. [Read more](/logging/grouping_inferences)
- `external_reference_id` (string) is useful if you want to associate your own internal identifier with the inference logged to Athina.

##### Custom Attributes

Optionally, you can also log custom attributes with your prompt. You can pass attribute name and attribute value as key-value pair in the `custom_attributes` object.

Note:- A prompt run cannot have duplicate attribute names

```json
{
  // ...otherFields,
  "custom_attributes": {
    "loggedBy": "John Doe",
    "age": 24,
    "isAdmin": true,
    "references": null
    //any other attribute to be logged
  }
}
```

##### Grounded Evals

For grounded evals like [Answer Similarity](/evals/preset_evals/grounded_evals#answer_similarity), you must also log a reference response (string) to compare against:

```json
{
    // ...otherFields,
    "expected_response": expected_response
}
```

- `expected_response` (string) is the reference response to compare against for evaluation purposes. This is useful for segmenting inference calls by expected response.

##### Function Calling

For function calling, you must also log the following fields:

```json
{
  // ...otherFields,
  "functions": function_call_request,
  "function_call_response": function_call_response,
}
```

#### Tools

For tools, you must log the following field

```json
{
  // ...otherFields,
  "tools": tools, // can be any json
  "tool_calls": tool_calls // can be any json
}
```

If tool_calls field is not present, we extract it from the openai completion response and log it in our database

<Callout>
  Tip: To avoid adding any latency to your application, log your inference as a
  fire-and-forget request.
