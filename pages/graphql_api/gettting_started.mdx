# Getting Started

## Get your API Key
Firstly you need to get your API key. Head to our [dashboard](https://app.athina.ai) and look under the user icon of navbar to the bottom left. You should find your API Key here. For example
<img src="/api-key.png" width="500" />

## Interactive Playground
You can use our interactive playground to experiment with queries and see the results. You can find the Interactive Playground [here](https://api.athina.ai/graphql). 

For authentication you can either
* Log into the dashboard or
* Use the API key you got from the previous step (Add these to the Request Headers)
```http
athina-api-key: "ATHINA_API_KEY"
```

After you are authenticated, hereâ€™s a sample request to get you started:
```graphql
query GetOrg { 
    getOrg {
        id name max_evals_per_month
    } 
}
```

## Accessing the Schema Documentation
You can find the Schema Documentation on the left side of the playground interface. This is your go-to resource for understanding the structure of the data you can query.
Visit our playground at https://api.athina.ai/graphql to explore more!


## IntelliSense and Keyboard Shortcuts
Our playground is equipped with IntelliSense, a handy tool that makes it easier to understand what types of fields you can query. Just press (ctrl + space)!

There are a few more keyboard shortcuts that you can use to make your experience more enjoyable.
* Prettify Query:  Shift-Ctrl-P (or press the prettify button)
* Merge Query:  Shift-Ctrl-M (or press the merge button)
* Run Query:  Ctrl-Enter (or press the play button)
* Auto Complete:  Ctrl-Space (or just start typing)
