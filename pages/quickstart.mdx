# Quick Start

### Get an API Key

Sign up for an account at https://app.athina.ai to get an API key.

### Easy Setup

_If you're using OpenAI chat completions in Python, you can get set up in 2 minutes_

The easiest way to start logging your inferences is to use our python SDK.

Run `pip install athina-logger`

_Note: This will not work if you are using OpenAI streaming_

### Using a different setup?

Next, start [logging your data](logging/log_inference_call/openai_chat).
